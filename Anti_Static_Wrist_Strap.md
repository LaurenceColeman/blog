While I was at it, I tested between the earth pin and the wrist contact.  
No beep. The result was apparently no connection.

Oh no! Have I been using a broken strap which was giving me no protection?
Worse still, did Ufixit send me a strap that didn't work? That would shake my world-view!

I assumed I must have broken the conductor by walking away from a workpiece while the clip was still attached, accidentally yanking it.

They are only a couple of Â£s so I bought a new one.
New one also showed no continuity. 
I must have misunderstood how the strap works.

Some quick research showed me that a strap should be about 1MOhm.

I had assumed it was just a copper wire with negligible resistance!
But it makes total sense: you don't want any current you accidentally touch to short straight through your wrist.
