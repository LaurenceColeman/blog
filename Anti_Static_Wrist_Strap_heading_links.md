# How an anti-static wrist-strap works

## story
**Is my wrist-strap broken?**  
I was exploring my options for grounding myself when I'm building electronics at home.  

For fun, I tried testing between the crocodile clip and the wrist contact of my [Anti-Static Wrist Strap](https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/Anti-Static-Wrist-Strap/IF145-071) for continuity.  
No beep. Apparently there's no connection.

Oh no!  
I assumed I must have broken the conductor by walking away from a workpiece while the clip was still attached, accidentally yanking it (I've definitely done this a few times).

Have I been using a broken strap?  
Was I congratulating myself for putting a useless, blue wristband on every time?  
Worse still, did ifixit send me a strap that didn't work? That would shake my world-view!
    
Cheap ones are only a couple of Â£s so I bought a new one from Ebay.
The new one also showed no connection between clip and strap. 
Is it likely I had two faulty straps from two different manufacturers?  
Maybe. But it's much more likely I just didn't understand how they work.

Some quick research showed me that a strap should be about 1MOhm:

No wonder the continuity test didn't register any current!   
I'd assumed it was just a copper wire with negligible resistance!
But it makes total sense: you don't want any current you accidentally touch to short straight through your wrist.

Well, now I have a spare wrist strap!
